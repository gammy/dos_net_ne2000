This is a set of IPX drivers that I have gotten to work with DOOM.  NOTE:
you must have an NE2000 compatible card to use the NE2000.COM.

The files LSL.COM and IPXODI.COM should work with any compatible, vendor
specific LAN card driver.

PS: Don't forget to edit the NET.CFG file to reflect the hardware settings
of your lancard!
